shops    storefronts, and the dashboard that runs them
phones   apps for a phone with no app store, and the store they install from
systems  a desktop in a browser tab, 2015 to version 7

### About

I build small software, and I usually own the whole thing: the schema, the
API, the interface, and the container it ships in. Ten years of it.

### Shops

[Shuttle](https://github.com/LR-Paris/Shuttle) is a storefront platform.
[Launchpad](https://github.com/LR-Paris/Launchpad) is the dashboard that
creates a shop, stocks it, and puts it online.

One Docker container per shop, nginx routing by path, orders and inventory
as CSV. Session auth with bcrypt and rate limiting, a file manager for the
shop directory, and a self-update that pulls a new version from GitHub while
the platform runs.

Express and SQLite underneath, React and Vite on top, one DigitalOcean
droplet holding all of it. The client shops on lrparisstore.com run on it.
Version 4.

### Phones

The Light Phone III has a black-and-white screen whose home screen is a list
of words. I wrote the apps it doesn't ship with, and the store they live in:
twenty Kotlin apps, one shared library, one marketplace with a submission
portal.
