```

### About

I build small software. Shops that sell things, apps for a phone with no app
store, and a desktop that only ever existed in a browser tab.

Ten years of it. I usually own the whole thing: the schema, the API, the
interface, and the container it ships in.

### Shops

[Shuttle](https://github.com/LR-Paris/Shuttle) is a storefront platform. [Launchpad](https://github.com/LR-Paris/Launchpad)
is the dashboard that creates a shop, stocks it, and puts it online. One Docker
container per shop, nginx routing by path, orders and inventory as CSV. Session
auth with bcrypt and rate limiting, a file manager for the shop directory, and a
self-update that pulls a new version from GitHub while the platform runs.

Express and SQLite underneath, React and Vite on top, one DigitalOcean droplet
holding all of it. The client shops on lrparisstore.com run on it. Version 4.

### Phones

The Light Phone III has a black and white screen and a home screen that is a
list of words. I wrote the apps it does not ship with, and the store they live
in: twenty apps in Kotlin, one shared library, one marketplace with a submission
portal.
